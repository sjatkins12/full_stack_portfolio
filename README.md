As a fun way to show off new skills in front-end development and micro-service architecture, I am building a complete application that hopefully I will deploy to a cloud provider.


Until the application is deployed, you will have to run the application locally to check it out.

## Prereqs
You will need docker and docker-compose installed on your machine to simplify the setup process.
[intall docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Also to run the front end server, you will need to install yarn. [install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Starting front-end server
`cd web && yarn && yarn start`

## Starting backend microservices
`docker-compose up`
